# Data Cleaning Process

To clean the data, we removed duplicate entries, changed missing entries to zero, standardized data format (text columns, numeric columns), validated geographic data by ensuring city, state, and postal code align with real world data. We cleaned categorical data by standardizing the 'Electric Vehicle Type' column (e.g., "Battery Electric Vehicle" vs. "BEV") and CAFV Eligibility (e.g., "Eligible" vs. "Yes").
